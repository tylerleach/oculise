                    <p class="lead">This project aims to take 3D meshes of cities from around the world that have been generated by Nearmaps aerial imagery technology
                        and convert them into virtual reality, for users to be able to navigate the rendered locations through
                        the use of virtual reality controllers. We want the user not only to be able to view the rendered locations but also have the ability to walk around on the streets as if they
                        were there and even fly around cities if they want.

                    <p class="lead">The target market for our project is members of the public that want to explore cities from a new perspective. Although the target market for the project is not specific to a
                        certain gender or age group, through research we can see that the primary user group will be males between the ages of 18 - 34 as they make up the majority of the user
                        market for virtual reality devices. A <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2017/virtual-reality-has-real-appeal-among-us-gamers.print.html">study from Nielson</a> reports that 44% of the people intending to purchase a virtual reality device are between the ages of 18 - 34.

                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p class="lead">The design methodology that we have chosen to use for the development of this project is the agile approach.</p>
                    <p>We chose the agile approach because:</p>
                    <li>Changes to the project requirements made by the client are easily applied and adapted when using an agile approach as the product is in constant development.</li>
                    <li>The approach allows for the product to be developed in incremental, rapid cycles.</li>
                    <li>Adaption to the clients needs and preferences throughout the development process is easier than with other design methodologies.</li>
                    <li>The agile approach reduces the risk of project failure as errors and mistakes can be found quickly and corrected along the development process.</li>
                    <li>It pushes for a fast product release with changes and improvements being able to be made after initial release.</li>
                    <li>Team productivity is higher when using the agile method as project members are constantly working on and improving the product.</li>

                    <h1 class="display-4" style="font-weight: 500">Development Environment:</h1>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p class="lead">The development environment that we have chosen to develop the project in is <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/xr">Unity XR</a> which is a game development platform for virtual reality(VR), augmented reality(AR) and mixed reality(MR). Unity XR uses C# as the coding language.
                    One of the key reason why we have chosen to use Unity XR is because it is a proven platform for virtual reality development which is supported by the fact that over 60% of all cross reality content is created with it.
                    Also C# the coding language used in Unity is similar to Java which we are familiar with from past experiences. Furthermore C# is a high level language and is relatively easy to learn with past experience in Java. Another key reason we chose Unity for our development environment is because
                    Unity XR has high compatibility for VR devices and as such can be used for development on different platforms, e.g. android, Oculus rift, HTC Vive, etc.
